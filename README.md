# FRAP measurement

This is FIJI/ImageJ macro for FRAP analysis on the images acquired by Micro-Manager.

The macro runs the following process:
Measure and plot the intensity over time on the ROI loaded from the ProjectorROIs generated by MM. (The macro can work with multiple ROIs by prompting the user to choose the one to analyze)
Report the actual time points of the acquisition (this was made for no delay time-lapse imaging)

Please check the instruction for details.
